Following, are the thirteen terms of sale in international trade as Terms of Sale reflected in the recent amendment to the International chamber of Commerce Terms of Trade (INCOTERMS). •EXW (Ex Works) (Named Place): A Term of Sale which means that the seller fulfils the obligation to deliver when he or she has made the goods available at his/her premises (i.e., works, factory, warehouse, etc.) to the buyer. In particular, the seller is not responsible for loading the goods in the vehicle provided by the buyer or for clearing the goods for export, unless otherwise agreed. The buyer bears all costs and risks involved in taking the goods from the seller’s premises to the desired destination. This term thus represents the minimum obligation for the seller. •FCA (Free Carrier) (Named Place): A Term of Sale which means the seller fulfils their obligation when he or she has handed over the goods, cleared for export, into the charge of the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point. If no precise point is indicated by the buyer, the seller may choose, within the place or range stipulated, where the carrier should take the goods into their charge. •FAS (Free Alongside Ship) (Named Port of Shipment): A Term of Sale which means the seller fulfils his obligation to deliver when the goods have been placed alongside the vessel on the quay or in lighters at the named port of shipment. This means that the buyer has to bear all costs and risks of loss of or damage to the goods from that moment. •FOB (Free On Board) (Named Port of Shipment): An International Term of Sale that means the seller fulfils his or her obligation to deliver when the goods have passed over the ship’s rail at the named port of shipment. This means that the buyer has to bear all costs and risks to loss of or damage to the goods from that point. The FOB term requires the seller to clear the goods for export. (Note: The U.S. Government sometimes uses a made-up term “FOB Destination” to require the seller to take responsibility for delivering the goods at destination rather than the correct Incoterm of DDP.) •CFR (Cost and Freight) (Named Port of Destination): A Term of Sale where the seller pays the costs and freight necessary to bring the goods to the named port of destination, but the risk of loss of or damage to the goods, as (continued) well as any additional costs due to events occurring after the time the goods have been delivered on board the vessel, is transferred from the seller to the buyer when the goods pass the ship’s rail in the port of shipment. The CFR term requires the seller to clear the goods for export. •CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight (Named Place of Destination): A Term of Sale where the seller has the same obligations as under the CFR, but also has to procure marine insurance against the buyer’s risk of loss or damage to the goods during the carriage. The seller contracts for insurance and pays the insurance premium. The CIF term requires the seller to clear the goods for export. •CPT (Carriage Paid To) (Named Place of Destination): A Term of Sale which means the seller pays the freight for the carriage of the goods to the named destination. The risk of loss of or damage to the goods, as well as any additional costs due to events occurring after the time the goods have been delivered to the carrier, is transferred from the seller to the buyer when the goods have been delivered into the custody of the carrier. If subsequent carriers are used for the carriage to the agreed upon destination, the risk passes when the goods have been delivered to the first carrier.The CPT term requires the seller to clear the goods for export. •CIP (Carriage and Insurance Paid To) (Named Place of Destination): A Term of Sale which means the seller has the same obligations as under CPT, but with the addition that the seller has to procure cargo insurance against the buyer’s risk of loss of or damage to the goods during the carriage. The seller contracts for insurance and pays the insurance premium. The buyer should note that under the CIP term the seller is required to obtain insurance only on minimum coverage. The CIP term requires the seller to clear the goods for export. •DAF (Delivered At Frontier) (Named Place): A Term of Sale which means the sellers fulfil their obligation to deliver when the goods have been made available, cleared for export, at the named point, and placed at the frontier, but before the customs border of the adjoining country. •DDU (Delivered Duty Unpaid) (Named Port of Destination): A Term of Sale where the seller fulfils his obligation to deliver when the goods have been made available at the named place in the country of importation. The seller has to bear the costs and risks involved in bringing the goods thereto (excluding duties, taxes, and other official charges payable upon importation) as well as the costs and risks of carrying out customs formalities. The buyer has to pay any additional costs and to bear any risks caused by failure to clear the goods in time. •DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) (Named Port of Destination): “Delivered Duty Paid” means that the seller fulfils his obligation to deliver when the goods have been made available at the named place in the country of importation. The seller has to bear the risks and costs, including duties, taxes, and other charges of delivering the goods thereto, clear for importation. While the EXW term represents the minimum obligation for the seller, DDP represents the maximum. •DES (Delivered Ex Ship) (Named Port of Destination): A Term of Sale where the seller fulfils his/her obligation to deliver when the goods have been made available to the buyer on board the ship, uncleared for import at the named port of destination. The seller has to bear all the costs and risks involved in bringing the goods to the named port destination. •DEQ (Delivered Ex Quay, [Duty Paid]) (Named Port of Destination): A Term of Sale which means the DDU term has been fulfilled when the goods have been available to the buyer on the quay (wharf) at the named port of destination, cleared for importation. The seller has to bear all risks and costs including duties, taxes, and other charges of delivering the goods thereto."

At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing—in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth—all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests. The SDGs build on decades of work by countries and the UN, including the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. In June 1992, at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, more than 178 countries adopted Agenda 21, a comprehensive plan of action to build a global partnership for sustainable development to improve human lives and protect the environment. Member States unanimously adopted the Millennium Declaration at the Millennium Summit in September 2000 at UN Headquarters in New York. The Summit led to the elaboration of eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to reduce extreme poverty by 2015. The Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development and the Plan of Implementation, adopted at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in South Africa in 2002, reaffirmed the global community's commitments to poverty eradication and the environment, and built on Agenda 21 and the Millennium Declaration by including more emphasis on multilateral partnerships. At the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 2012, Member States adopted the outcome document ""The Future We Want"" in which they decided, inter alia, to launch a process to develop a set of SDGs to build upon the MDGs and to establish the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. The Rio +20 outcome also contained other measures for implementing sustainable development, including mandates for future programmes of work in development financing, small island developing states and more. In 2013, the General Assembly set up a 30-member Open Working Group to develop a proposal on the SDGs. In January 2015, the General Assembly began the negotiation process on the post-2015 development agenda. The process culminated in the subsequent adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with 17 SDGs at its core, at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015. 2015 was a landmark year for multilateralism and international policy shaping, with the adoption of several major agreements: ● Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (March 2015) ● Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development (July 2015) ● Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its 17 SDGs was adopted at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in New York in September 2015. ● Paris Agreement on Climate Change (December 2015) Now, the annual High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development serves as the central UN platform for the follow-up and review of the SDGs. Today, the Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG) in the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) provides substantive support and capacity-building for the SDGs and their related thematic issues, including water, energy, climate, oceans, urbanization, transport, science and technology, the Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR), partnerships and Small Island Developing States."

Weight in the lower hold increases stability. A vessel is stiff if it has high stability, and tender if it has low stability. In a ship, stability is indicated by several characteristics. Initial stability is measured by the metacentric height; also known as “GM.” If GM is low, the vessel makes long slow rolls, and is considered tender. When GM is too high, the vessel is considered stiff, and may return violently to the upright position when rolling, with possible damage to cargo and injury to passengers and crew. Other stability considerations include the vessel’s range of stability, maximum righting arm, and the angle of heel at which the maximum righting arm occurs."

Their role is to integrate the services of different sub-contracting companies (transport, storage, value-added operations, etc.) and to coordinate and control them through management of the associated information flows. There are other names for these three categories. The first and the second are frequently referred to as Third Party Logistics (3PL). The third corresponds to the terminology submitted by Accenture of Fourth Party Logistics (4PL). Finally, even though uncommon and very close to 4PL, the name of Fifth Party Logistics (5PL) is attributed to Logistics Service Providers who plan, organise, and implement logistics solutions on behalf of a contracting party (in particular, information systems) by exploiting the appropriate technologies (conceptual level)."

Juran used to describe the Pareto principle, which he first defined in 1950. (The principle was used much earlier in economics and inventory control methods.) The principle suggests most effects come from relatively few causes; that is, 80% of the effects come from 20% of the possible causes. The 20% of the possible causes are referred to as the “vital few;” the remaining causes are referred to as the “useful many.” When Juran first defined this principle, he referred to the remaining causes as the “trivial many,” but realizing that no problems are trivial in quality assurance, he changed it to “useful many.”"

Every piece of inventory that is purchased and stored in inventory has some sort of cost associated with it, such as labour, risk/insurance, storage, and freight. This metric is used to figure out how much profit can be made on your current inventory, and it may also be used to help your suppliers map out their production cycles. Inventory turnover is an important indicator of the efficiency of your supply chain, the quality and demand of the inventory you carry, and if you have good buying practices. Generally speaking, a higher turnover rate is better, while a lower turnover rate suggests inefficiency and difficulty turning stock into revenue. Each type of industry will have different benchmarks and norms. For instance, a fresh produce supplier will have many more turns than a textile/clothing supplier."

It considers the high-level production plan and rough cut capacity availability, and aligns with management targets for linearity and permissible level of changes. Once accepted, the MPS specifies the date and quantity requirements used by MRP to explode demand through the bill of materials. While most often for end items, variations of MPS allow planning critical lower levels such as major sub-assemblies based on a forecast that is then consumed by customer orders for finished goods that require those sub-assemblies. The MPS is the main driver for the rest of the planning and scheduling system, and the level of success in attaining a realistic MPS often indicates how well the other detailed parts of the system function."
